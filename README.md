## Code Examples by Joseph Johnson IV

#### This is a repository to hold some of the programs I have written in my courses at The University of Central Florida.

##### Programs are separated by language into different branches

**See my Android Mobile Application Repository**
_WaterWise:_ https://github.com/Hydrocoolapps/WaterWise

**C Programs:**

_cpuSchedulerPt1_ will request you give it the name of the input file. In this case, the input is _cpuSchedulerPt1IN.txt_.

_memManagement_ will also request an input file. In this case, the input is _memManagementIN.txt_.

_ListString_ and _roll_ can be run without any input.

**Haskell Programs:**

These can all be loaded and run directly.

**Java Programs:**

_BankAccount_ can be run directly, I have added a sample output image as well.

_Binary Search Trees_ cannot be run without adding execution code to _BinarySearchTrees.java_.

_MySQL Front End GUI_ requires that a MySQL server is already set up listening on port 3306. The SQL script will set up the database, and _QueryGUI.java_ can be run to launch the GUI. I have      also included sample execution images

_Cipher_, _dfschecker_, and _Duel_ can all be run directly

**Python Programs:**

These can all be run directly

**Verilog Modules:**

These can be simulated directly. I have written a module for each of them to configure a simulation.
